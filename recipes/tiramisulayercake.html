<h3>Description</h3>
    
<p> My friend taught me this recipe in middle school, and I have never stopped
        making it for my family since. The coffee and vanilla cake layers blend so 
        well with the marscapone cream cheese, and the tiramisu flavor is brought 
        together by the touches of rum liquer added into the various components of
        the cake. Delicious but not too sweet, perfect for a nice dinner, a sweet 
        breakfast, a celebratory event, or just for a everday dessert. </p>

        <li>1 (15.25 ounce) package moist white cake mix</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>3 large egg white</li>
        <li>1/3 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon instant coffee powder</li>
        <li>1/4 cup coffee</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon coffee flavored liqueur</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) container mascarpone cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons coffee flavored liqueur</li>
        <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>1/4 cup confectioners' sugar</li>

        <li>1 (1 ounce) square semisweet chocolate</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees 
            F (175 C). Grease and flour three 9-inch pans.</li>
        <li>To make the cake: Beat cake mix, water, egg whites, and
            oil in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed 
            until well combined, about 2 minutes. Divide 2/3 of the 
            batter between 2 prepared pans. Stir instant coffee into remaining
            batter; pour into the remaining prepared pan. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into 
            the center of cakes comes out clean, 25 minutes. Cool cakes in
            the pans for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to
            cool completely.</li>
        <li>To make the syrup: Combine brewed coffee and coffee liqueur 
            in a measuring cup; set aside.</li>
        <li>To make the filling: Beat mascarpone, confectioners' sugar, and
            coffee liqueur in a medium bowl with an electric mixer on low 
            speed until smooth. Cover with plastic wrap and place in the 
            refrigerator to keep cool.</li>
        <li>To make the frosting: Beat cream, confectioners' sugar, and 
            coffee liqueur in a medium bowl with an electric mixer on
            medium-high speed until stiff. Fold 1/2 cup frosting into 
            chilled filling until combined. Store frosting and filling,
            covered, in the refrigerator to keep cool.</li>
        <li>To assemble the cake: Place 1 plain cake layer on a serving
            plate. Using a thin skewer, poke holes in cake, about 1 inch apart. 
            Pour 1/3 of the coffee syrup over cake, then cover with 1/2 of the filling.
            Top with coffee-flavored cake layer; poke holes in cake. Pour 
            another 1/3of the coffee syrup over cake and cover with remaining 
            filling. Top with remaining cake layer; poke holes in cake. Pour 
            remaining coffee syrup on top. Spread sides and top of cake with frosting. </li>
        <li>To garnish the cake: Place cocoa powder in a sieve and lightly dust
            top of cake. Run a vegetable peeler down the edge of chocolate 
            square to form curls. Scatter chocolate curls over cake. </li>
        <li>Chill cake in the refrigerator for at least 30 mniutes before serving.</li>
